# Structural Instability Index (SII)
**Distance-to-Collapse Physics Layer**

## What This Module Is

SII measures **how far an entity or population is from structural collapse.**

This is not a ranking metric.
It is **absolute collapse physics.**

## Why It Exists

Loss happens after collapse.

SII measures collapse **before** loss.

It detects:

• Silent churn formation

• Default funnels

• Systemic fragility

• Structural debt pressure


## What It Computes

| Zone  | Meaning                |
|-------|------------------------|
| GREEN | Structurally stable    |
| AMBER | Early-warning zone     |
| RED   | Collapse trajectory    |



## What This Enables

• Collapse sentinel systems

• Mandatory escalation triggers

• Executive risk zoning

• Counterfactual intervention simulation


SII turns analytics into physics.
