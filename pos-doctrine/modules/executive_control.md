# Executive Cognitive Control Plane
**The Nervous System of a Living Enterprise**

## What This Module Is

The Executive Control Plane is the **real-time nervous system** of POS.

It gives executives **situational awareness over a living enterprise civilization.**

## Why It Exists

Executives today receive:

• KPIs

• Dashboards

• Reports

But they do not receive systemic health, collapse funnels, or decision law visibility.

POS changes that.

## What It Displays

| View                     | Meaning                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Regime Distribution      | Structural state of civilization  |
| Health Zoning            | Collapse exposure                 |
| Drift Funnels            | Crisis formation                  |
| Escalation Exposure      | Governance load                   |
| Counterfactual Simulations | Decision impact                |


## What This Enables

• CAIO cockpit

• Central-bank-grade early warning

• Sovereign governance awareness

• Strategic foresight

POS does not report.
It makes civilizations visible.
