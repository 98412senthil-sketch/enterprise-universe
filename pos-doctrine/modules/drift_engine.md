# Drift Engine
**Civilization Motion & Early-Warning Layer**

## What This Module Is

The Drift Engine measures **mass migration of populations between latent regimes over time.**

This is how POS detects **collapse funnels before losses occur.**

## Why It Exists

Loss appears **after collapse is already inevitable.**

Drift appears **while collapse is still preventable.**

POS governs motion toward loss, not just loss itself.

## What It Measures

| Signal                    | Meaning                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Regime population change  | Civilization migration   |
| Direction of flow         | Collapse funnels         |
| Velocity of change        | Crisis acceleration      |


## What This Enables

• Systemic early warning

• Regime stability governance

• Collapse funnel detection

• Executive macro awareness

Drift is the heartbeat of a civilization.
