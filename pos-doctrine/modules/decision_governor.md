## Decision Governor
**Machine-Executable Sovereign Decision Law**

## What This Module Is

The Decision Governor converts structural risk into **formal decision law.**

This is where automation ends and **governance begins.**

## Why It Exists

Most AI systems recommend actions.
They do not define **what is lawful, forbidden, or escalatable.**

POS makes decision law executable.

## What It Defines

| Element          | Meaning                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Decision State   | Legal enterprise state         |
| Allowed Actions  | Lawful actions                 |
| Forbidden Actions| Illegal actions                |
| Escalation Rules | Mandatory authority transfer   |
| Sovereign Owner  | Human decision authority       |



## What This Enables

• Mandatory CRO escalation

• Regulator-aligned AI governance

• Lawful automation boundaries

• Audit defensibility

POS does not recommend decisions.

It governs them.
