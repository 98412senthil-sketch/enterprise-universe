# Latent Regime Engine
**Structural Reality Discovery Layer**

## What This Module Is

The Latent Regime Engine discovers the **hidden structural organization of an enterprise civilization.**

It does not segment customers.
It discovers **jurisdictions of decision law.**

Regimes define where different rules of governance apply.

## Why It Exists

Most AI systems treat populations as homogeneous.

Real enterprises are **structurally segmented by latent behavioral regimes.**

Without regime discovery:

• Drift cannot be measured

• Collapse funnels cannot be detected

• Decision law cannot be applied

## What It Discovers

| Output      | Meaning                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Regime      | Structural jurisdiction       |
| Belief      | Confidence envelope           |
| Latent axes | Enterprise reality geometry   |

## What This Enables

• Drift detection

• Collapse trajectory mapping

• Health zoning

• Sovereign decision governance


Regimes are not clusters.
They are civilizational gravity wells.
