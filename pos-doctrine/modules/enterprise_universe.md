# Enterprise Universe
**The Living Reality Layer of POS**

## What This Module Is

The **Enterprise Universe** is a living economic civilization.
It is not a dataset.
It is a **time-evolving enterprise** population governed by macro-micro causal physics.

All POS governance operates over this living world.

## Why It Exists

Traditional AI is trained on static historical data.

But real enterprises exist inside:


• Economic seasons

• Shocks

• Drift

• Regime transitions

• Collapse trajectories


POS requires a living reality layer to govern.

## What It Models

| Dimension       | Meaning                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| Income          | Macro sensitivity          |
| Monthly Spend   | Consumption behavior       |
| Txn Count       | Activity physics           |
| Debt            | Structural risk            |
| Dormancy        | Churn physics              |
| Volatility      | Regime sensitivity         |
| Lifecycle       | Population ontology        |
| Segments        | Civilizational structure   |
| Macro Regimes   | Economic climate           |
| Shocks          | Systemic stress            |
| Drift           | Civilization motion        |

## What This Enables


• Early-warning systems

• Collapse funnel detection

• Counterfactual policy simulation

• Regime migration governance

• Executive nervous systems

This module turns POS from an analytics system into a civilization governor.
