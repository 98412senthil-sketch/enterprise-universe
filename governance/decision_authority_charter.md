# Decision Authority Charter – Regime AI System

## Background
Modern AI systems generate recommendations based on probabilistic inference and historical data patterns.  
While these systems can optimize operational efficiency, they cannot own business risk, regulatory accountability, or ethical responsibility.  
In regulated and high-impact domains such as financial services, AI outputs must therefore be governed through explicit human authority structures.  
This charter establishes the mandatory human decision ownership framework for the Regime-Aware Decision Intelligence System to ensure that accountability, risk governance, and escalation responsibilities remain clearly defined and enforceable.

## Analysis
The Latent Regime AI system classifies hidden business operating states and provides drift-based risk telemetry.  
However, regime identification alone does not constitute a business decision.  
Without formal human decision ownership, automated actions may continue during unstable or deteriorating regimes, exposing the organization to financial loss, regulatory breaches, and reputational damage.  
This charter defines mandatory review thresholds, escalation rules, and override protocols that convert probabilistic model outputs into controlled, auditable, and accountable human decisions.

## Decision Ownership Table

| Regime | Regime Meaning | Decision Owner | Authority Scope | Mandatory Reviews | Escalation Trigger |
|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| R0 | Stable Operations | Portfolio Head | Pricing, credit limits, campaigns, upsell | Monthly review | Drift ≥ 10% |
| R1 | Warning / Deteriorating | Risk Manager | Monitoring, soft controls, policy tightening | Weekly review | Drift ≥ 12% |
| R2 | Stress / High Risk | Chief Risk Officer (CRO) | Restriction, recovery, portfolio freezes | Daily review | Drift ≥ 15% |

## Mandatory Human Review Rules
• Any regime change requires human acknowledgment  
• Any drift ≥ 10% requires risk team notification  
• Any drift ≥ 15% requires CRO escalation  
• Any R2 regime blocks automated business actions  

## Accountability Statement
The Decision Owner remains fully accountable for outcomes arising from AI-assisted actions.
