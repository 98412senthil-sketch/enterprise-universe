# Enterprise Universe — Reference Implementation

This repository contains a **research reference implementation** of selected components related to the Probabilistic Operating System (POS).

It is intended to:
- Validate architectural concepts
- Explore simulation and governance mechanics
- Support experimentation and learning

This repository is **not**:
- A production system
- A complete implementation of POS
- A commercial platform

---

## Relationship to POS

The Probabilistic Operating System (POS) defines:
- Governance doctrine
- Architectural principles
- Constitutional constraints

This repository provides **one possible executable interpretation** of some POS modules, including:
- Enterprise universe simulation
- Regime discovery
- Drift monitoring
- Structural instability indicators
- Decision governance mechanics

POS doctrine always governs implementation — not the reverse.

---

## Status

This repository is:
- Experimental
- Subject to change
- Provided for research and exploration purposes

Stability, APIs, and interfaces are **not guaranteed**.
