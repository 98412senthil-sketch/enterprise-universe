# Enterprise Universe — Reference Implementation

This repository contains a **research reference implementation** of selected components related to the Probabilistic Operating System (POS).

It is intended to:
- Validate architectural concepts
- Explore simulation and governance mechanics
- Support experimentation and learning

This repository is **not**:
- A production system
- A complete implementation of POS
- A commercial platform

## Relationship to POS

The Probabilistic Operating System (POS) defines:
- Governance doctrine
- Architectural principles
- Constitutional constraints

This repository provides **one possible executable interpretation** of some POS modules, including:
- Enterprise universe simulation
- Regime discovery
- Drift monitoring
- Structural instability indicators
- Decision governance mechanics

POS doctrine always governs implementation — not the reverse.

## Illustrative Snapshots

The following snapshots are generated from a simulated enterprise universe and are provided solely to build intuition around selected POS concepts.

They are:
- Based on synthetic data
- Scenario-specific
- Non-exhaustive
- Intended for conceptual understanding only

They do not represent production behavior, benchmarks, or empirical validation.

### Regime Discovery (Illustrative)

![Latent Regime Discovery](snapshots/regime_discovery.png)

Illustrates how latent structural regimes may emerge from simulated enterprise behavior.
Regime membership is probabilistic and may evolve over time.

### Structural Drift Over Time (Illustrative)

![Structural Drift](snapshots/drift_dynamics.png)

Illustrates how population distribution across regimes may shift over time,
highlighting early-warning signals without implying immediate failure.

### Structural Instability Index (Illustrative)

![Structural Instability Index](snapshots/sii_distribution.png)

Illustrates a relative structural risk surface derived from simulated enterprise dynamics.
The index represents distance-to-instability, not a failure prediction.


## Status

This repository is:
- Experimental
- Subject to change
- Provided for research and exploration purposes

Stability, APIs, and interfaces are **not guaranteed**.
