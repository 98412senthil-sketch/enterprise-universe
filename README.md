# Enterprise Universe — Reference Implementation

This repository contains a **research reference implementation** of selected components related to the Probabilistic Operating System (POS).

It is intended to:
- Validate architectural concepts
- Explore simulation and governance mechanics
- Support experimentation and learning

This repository is **not**:
- A production system
- A complete implementation of POS
- A commercial platform

---

## Relationship to POS

The Probabilistic Operating System (POS) defines:
- Governance doctrine
- Architectural principles
- Constitutional constraints

This repository provides **one possible executable interpretation** of some POS modules, including:
- Enterprise universe simulation
- Regime discovery
- Drift monitoring
- Structural instability indicators
- Decision governance mechanics

POS doctrine always governs implementation — not the reverse.

## Illustrative Snapshots

The following snapshots are generated from a simulated enterprise universe and are provided solely to build intuition around selected POS concepts.

They are:
- Based on synthetic data
- Scenario-specific
- Non-exhaustive
- Intended for conceptual understanding only

They do not represent production behavior, benchmarks, or empirical validation.

### Regime Distribution (Illustrative)

![Regime Distribution](snapshots/regime_distribution_t5.png)

Illustrates the relative population distribution across latent structural regimes
in a simulated enterprise universe at a given point in time.


## Status

This repository is:
- Experimental
- Subject to change
- Provided for research and exploration purposes

Stability, APIs, and interfaces are **not guaranteed**.
